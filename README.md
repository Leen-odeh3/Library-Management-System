## **Library Management System: Database Project**

## **Background**:

 A local library wishes to transition from their traditional book-keeping to a more robust digital system. They want a platform to efficiently track books, borrowers, loans, returns, and offer insights into borrowing trends.

## **Objective**:

Design and implement a relational database using MS SQL that supports the library's operations and offers extensive querying capabilities.
## **Requirements**:

### **1. Design an Entity Relationship Model (ERM) Diagram**:

- **Entities**: Illustrate entities: **`Books`**, **`Borrowers`**, and **`Loans`**.
- **Attributes**: Detail attributes for each entity.
- **Relationships**: Exhibit connections between entities.
- **Connectivity and Cardinality**: Notate the relationship type between entities.
- **Keys**: Mark primary (PK) and foreign keys (FK).
- **Tools**: Opt for ERDPlus, Lucidchart, or similar tools. Include the diagram in the repository.

### **2. Design the Relational Schema using MS SQL**:

- **Books**:
    - BookID (PK)
    - Title
    - Author
    - ISBN
    - Published Date
    - Genre
    - Shelf Location
    - Current Status ('Available' or 'Borrowed')
- **Borrowers**:
    - BorrowerID (PK)
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Email
    - Date of Birth
    - Membership Date
- **Loans**:
    - LoanID (PK)
    - BookID (FK)
    - BorrowerID (FK)
    - Date Borrowed
    - Due Date
    - Date Returned (NULL if not returned yet)

### **3. Build and Seed the Database**:

- Construct the database in MS SQL.
- Seed with fictional data: Populate 1000 books, 1000 borrowers, and 1000 loan records. **Include DML scripts for seeding** in the GitHub repository. (Try generating the data by yourself and make sure it is consistent and preferably meaningful. You may use some websites, tools, or scripts to generate this data).

### **4. Complex Queries and Procedures**:

1. **List of Borrowed Books**: Retrieve all books borrowed by a specific borrower, including those currently unreturned.
2. **Active Borrowers with CTEs**: Identify borrowers who've borrowed 2 or more books but haven't returned any using CTEs.
3. **Borrowing Frequency using Window Functions**: Rank borrowers based on borrowing frequency.
4. **Popular Genre Analysis using Joins and Window Functions**: Identify the most popular genre for a given month.
5. **Stored Procedure - Add New Borrowers**:
    - **Procedure Name**: **`sp_AddNewBorrower`**
    - **Purpose**: Streamline the process of adding a new borrower.
    - **Parameters**: **`FirstName`**, **`LastName`**, **`Email`**, **`DateOfBirth`**, **`MembershipDate`**.
    - **Implementation**: Check if an email exists; if not, add to **`Borrowers`**. If existing, return an error message.
    - **Return**: The new **`BorrowerID`** or an error message.
6. **Database Function - Calculate Overdue Fees**:
    - **Function Name**: **`fn_CalculateOverdueFees`**
    - **Purpose**: Compute overdue fees for a given loan.
    - **Parameter**: **`LoanID`**
    - **Implementation**: Charge fees based on overdue days: $1/day for up to 30 days, $2/day after.
    - **Return**: Overdue fee for the **`LoanID`**.
7. **Database Function - Book Borrowing Frequency**:
    - **Function Name**: **`fn_BookBorrowingFrequency`**
    - **Purpose**: Gauge the borrowing frequency of a book.
    - **Parameter**: **`BookID`**
    - **Implementation**: Count the number of times the book has been issued.
    - **Return**: Borrowing count of the book.
8. **Overdue Analysis**: List all books overdue by more than 30 days with their associated borrowers.
9. **Author Popularity using Aggregation**: Rank authors by the borrowing frequency of their books.
10. **Genre Preference by Age using Group By and Having**: Determine the preferred genre of different age groups of borrowers. (Groups are (0,10), (11,20), (21,30)…)
11. **Stored Procedure - Borrowed Books Report**:
    - **Procedure Name**: **`sp_BorrowedBooksReport`**
    - **Purpose**: Generate a report of books borrowed within a specified date range.
    - **Parameters**: **`StartDate`**, **`EndDate`**
    - **Implementation**: Retrieve all books borrowed within the given range, with details like borrower name and borrowing date.
    - **Return**: Tabulated report of borrowed books.
12. **Trigger Implementation**
- Design a trigger to log an entry into a separate **`AuditLog`** table whenever a book's status changes from 'Available' to 'Borrowed' or vice versa. The **`AuditLog`** should capture **`BookID`**, **`StatusChange`**, and **`ChangeDate`**.
13. **SQL Stored Procedure with Temp Table**:
- Design a stored procedure that retrieves all borrowers who have overdue books. Store these borrowers in a temporary table, then join this temp table with the **`Loans`** table to list out the specific overdue books for each borrower.

## BONUS
Weekly peak days: The library is planning to employ a new part-time worker. This worker will work 3 days weekly in the library. From the data you have, determine the most 3 days in the week that have the most share of the loans and display the result of each day as a percentage of all loans. Sort the results from the highest percentage to the lowest percentage. (eg. 25.18% of the loans happen on Monday...)
